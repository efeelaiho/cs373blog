      <div id="text">
        <p>Alright, I confess. Things didn't go so hot with Phase 2. Somehow I feel our entire team underestimated the time it would 
        take to make our entrie site dynamic.There was just so many things that we didn't understand, one, being how to connect MySQL 
        with our Rackspace server. Eventually we figured it out but it was already Tuesday afternoon and less than nine hours until it was due.
        Why, we decided to hold off until Monday afternoon to start on Phase 2 is beyond me. Fortunately, Wednesday, after Phase 2 was due, we headedd
        back into the lab and were able to make our site dynamic with ease. Within an hour and 30 minutes actually. Just goes to show you the importance 
        of starting assignments early at a pace that doesn't have you sweating bullets.
        </p>
        <p>So with MySQL we were able to run a for loop in or html code that creatse a gallery view of all our artists and albums. It was extremely relieving.
        I couldn't possibly imagine creating a gallery grid with 150+ artists/albums, and it being completely static. The thought just made me shed a tear.
        Along with creating the gallery views we've also been able to implement individual pages for each artist and album through using MySQL. </p>
