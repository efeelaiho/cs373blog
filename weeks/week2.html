      <h1>Week Two</h1>
      
      <div id="text">
      <p>The class has picked up quite rapidly this past week, but I have to give it to Downing, he knows how to make a class awesome. This passed Tuesday our Collatz assignment was due, and I definitely think that assignment was s good start to the course. Through this project, I got to practice more with GitHub and it's features, like tracking issues, and I got more familiar with Travis CI. We've spent most of lecture learning about iterations and operators in Python, and I've got to say this is some real interesting stuff. Downing is slowly getting me hooked on Python, and just a few days ago I started dabbling into some Flask development. One thing that Downing taught that particularly stood out to me was the use of generators. Generators functions allow you to declare a function that behaves like an iterator. Like so: </p>
      <pre><code> 
        def add(i, j) :
            return i + j
            print(add(2,3)) # 5
            print(lambda i, j : i + j (2, 3)) 
            # 5, similar to add(), doesn't require a function name or a return. 
            #The return value is placed after the colon.
        </code></pre>

       <p>Overall the class is going well, however, the quizzes can get a little tricky, and I have been doing so hot on them, even though I study the night before for them. As far as his Socratic teaching method is going, I've only been called on ONCE so far. ONCE. While my friends in the class have been called on numerous of times. Either I'm not in the registrar, or I'm just lucky. Hopefully the latter.</p> 
      <h2>Tip of the Week</h2>

      <p>GitHub is more than just a tool for version control. It is a community for developers/programmers/software engineers. Go and look at Open Source projects, contribute to existing projects, and explore what GitHub has to offer. Instead of always checking out what's "trending" of Twitter, check on what's trending on. I recently found this repository with a plethora of free programming books, AND a repository that features many engineering blogs for some of the hottest companies/startups. Check them out:</p>
