      <h1>Week Two</h1>
      
      <div id="text">
      <p>The class has picked up quite rapidly this past week, but I have to give it to Downing, he knows how to make a class awesome. This passed Tuesday our Collatz assignment was due, and I definitely think that assignment was s good start to the course. Through this project, I got to practice more with Github and it's features, like tracking issues, and I got more familiar with Travis CI. We've spent most of lecture learning about iterations and operators in Python, and I've got to say this is some real interesting stuff. Downing is slowly getting me hooked on Python, and just a few days ago I started dabbling into some Flask development. One thing that Downing taught that particularly stood out to me was the use of generators. Generators functions allow you to declare a function that behaves like an iterator. Like so: </p>
      <pre><code> 
        def add(i, j) :
          return i + j
          print(add(2,3)) # 5
          print(lambda i, j : i + j (2, 3)) # 5, similar to add(), doesn't require a function name or a return. The return value is placed after the colon.
      </code></pre>
