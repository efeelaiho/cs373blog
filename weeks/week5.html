      <h1>Week Five</h1>
      
      <div id="text">
        <p>So we just finished Phase I on our website. And I must say this project seems like it could be overwhelming. But nonetheless, 
        our website is looking very chic. So essentially I decided to do Full-Stack Development. Essentially I want to work on some scale on our website ranging from
        Front-End to Unit Testing. This is primarily so I can get a good feel of what I want to do in my career. Right now, I'm currently more
        focused on the front-end of the website, and have fully discovered my craving for aesthetics. Did I mention our website looks chic?
        </p>
        
      <p>There are many things that I still want to inplement into our website, such as a video-background (one of the other groups has one and it's pretty clutch), and 
      some way for music of a specif artist to play when you go to that artist's page. Have a good feeling that the Spotify Web API can accomadate for this.
      However, in this next phase, Phase II, we have to implement SQL into our project, thus making our site completely dynamic. This seems very daunting, considering 
      I have no prior experience in MySQL or PostgresSQL, but hopefully I learn more about these widely used relational database management systems. I'll
      defintely read up on it more even after this project is said and over with. On Wednesday, Downing briefly went over some functions of SQL, such as 
      cross join, theta-join and natural join. </p>
    
      <h2>Tip of the Week</h2>
      
      <p>For the love of all things succulent in sugar, do not wait till forever to merge your development branch into your master branch. 
      You may end up with a pull request with over 100+ commits, and Github could probably have a hard time merging dev into master. Lesson learned. </p>
