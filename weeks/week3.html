      <p> Holy cow! These quizzes are killing me! No matter how hard I try to study for them, somehow I get tripped up.
      Hopefully I either get better at the quizzes, or the quizzes get easier. Preferably a mixture of both. But in other news, I
      received full credit for the first project *pats self on back*. Oh here's something new, Downing actually ranks the students in the
      class. Personally I don't like it. In a class where we are supposed to collaborate and help each other, I don't find this feature in grading
      very conducive. However, it is a good indication if you are really grasping the material compared to your peers.<br> <br>
      
      So we just finished our second assignment, called Netflix. In which we had to implement an algorithm that makes predictions 
      about how much someone is going to enjoy a movie based on their movie preferences. At first setting up the project was a bit 
      confusing, and I didn't unsterstand the best way to start. But I utilized the TA's to help me understand the project fully, which 
      led me to fly through the project with ease. I expect nothing less than full credit. 
      <br><br>
      Now that the first two projects are complete, the fun begins! Definitely looking forward to spend hours in the lab
      with my group, making an awesome web app. I don't expect things to get easy from here, but I do expect things will be
      exceedingly enjoyable.
