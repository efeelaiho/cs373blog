      <p>Holy cow! These quizzes are killing me! No matter how hard I try to study for them, somehow I get tripped up.
      Hopefully I either get better at the quizzes, or the quizzes get easier. Preferably a mixture of both. <br>
      
      So we just finished our second assignment, called Netflix. In which we had to implement an algorithm that makes predictions 
      about how much someone is going to enjoy a movie based on their movie preferences. At first setting up the project was a bit 
      confusing, and I didn't unsterstand the best way to start. But I utilized the TA's to help me understand the project fully.
