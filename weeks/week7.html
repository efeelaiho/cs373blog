      <h1>Week Seven</h1>
      
      <div id="text">
        <p> I think I may have hit my boiling point with this phase. Scratch that. I had definitely hit my boiling point is this phase, and I need
        a nap, along with a juicebox. It wasn't that the requirements were hard, rather that there were many requirements and I just had envisioned that 
        everything would be as perfect as I planned. However, our site is complete and I'm pretty happy with it. We were able to add a plethora 
        of extra artists to the database, and were capable of adding a few more minor aesthetic touches to the website, like adding an ico image
        for the tab bar, for instance. Through all of it, there was one feature to the website, that had my brain jumping through circles of fire, and
        that was implementing a video background. So I learned into different tools, and I finally came along to BigVideo JS...and boom, video
        background was playing,however it was doing this funky thing where it will show a timestamp/timer on the webpage before the video loaded.
        It was very irritating and visually displeasing to not only myself, but to my teammates as well. Long story short...we decided to take the loss
        and skip implementing the video background in order to finish what was actually required of us. 
        </p>
        <p>My team and I were second to presebt our website to the class, and I believe our present went really smooth, and it was very comedic.</p>
      <p>Overall this class was phenomenal. I applaud Dr.Downing and give him the praise. I've learned so much that I can incorporate into my own personal projects, and
      the workplace.</p>
        
      <h2>Tip of the Week</h2>
      
      <p>TAKE THIS CLASS. TAKE IT. YOU WILL LAUGH. YOU WILL DEFINITELY CRY (not really....okay, maybe). BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY YOU WILL
      LEARN MORE THAN YOU THINK YOU CAN IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME. #JUSTDOIT</p>
