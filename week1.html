      <h1>Week One</h1>
      
      <div id="text">
      <p>I have been waiting patiently to finally take Software Engineering. Every registration this class fills
        up without fail. As an aspiring software engineer I knew I had to take this course before I graduate, especially since I've been
        to several final round interviews for Software Engineering Intern positions at top companies, including Twitter and Facebook, but 
        fell short of receiving an offer. Hopefully the skills I will obtain from this class will make me a better candidate.</p>
        
        
        <p>The syllabus seems really intimidating, but I am more than eager to learn all the concepts Downing has to offer. I 
        already had some experience with Git/Github from a previous internship at a startup, but never had much experience with unit testing 
        and continuous integration.</p> 
        
        <p>For anyone debating on whether or not to take this course, do it! Downing is sheer brilliance, and I find his 
        lectures nothing but rewarding. Downing uses the Socratic method of teaching, in which you are assigned material to review over, and during class
        he'll call on people randomly to not only answer questions, but to also stimulate their critical thinking. This style of 
        teaching is used at several law schools across the nation, so for those future patent attorneys, get used to it. I for one 
        love this method of teaching. I'm usually the guy in the back of the class who dozes off every now and then, but now I wouldn't even dare.
        The anticipation of being called upon is overwhelming, and definitely keeps me on my toes, even after a giant meal of 
        Chick-fil-A.</p>
